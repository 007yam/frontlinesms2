# Creating a Poll #

_A [poll][1] is a type of activity which allows you to see a [graphical representation][6] of the responses to a question. When creating a [poll][1] you will be able to enter the question and select who to send the question to. You will also be able to set up a [keyword][2]. A [keyword][2] allows FrontlineSMS to recognise which incoming messages are for [polls][1] and which aren't. It will also help the system determine which [poll][1] the message belongs to. This gives you the option to let FrontlineSMS automatically sort incoming messages into [poll][1] and you will be notified when this has happened. There are two types of responses you can set: [Yes/No][3] or a [Multiple Choice][4] style answer. You can also set up an [automatic reply][5] that is sent to every message received for that [poll][1]._

### How to Create a Poll

1.  From the messages tab click on 'Create New Activity'.
2.  A new window will appear and you will be presented with a number of options. Choose "Poll" and click next

### Enter Question

After clicking next, you will be prompted to select a question type and enter a question:

![alt text][12]

**Question Type:** 
Yes or No: Select this if your question has a Yes or No answer. For example, the question "Do you like the colour Red?", could have a Yes or No Answer.
Multiple Choice Question: Select this if your question has a number of different answers. For example, with the question "Do you like the colour Red?", you could get more detailed responses by having a range of answers such as, "Yes", "Quite a lot", "Not a lot" or "No".  
If you select this option you will have the opportunity to input the possible responses in the following screens.

**Enter Question:**
Here you will find an area for you to enter your question. You can re-size the text entry box by clicking and dragging the bottom right hand corner of it.  
  
If you simply want to collect responses and not send out a question then check the "Do not send a message for this poll (Collect responses only)" box. This might be useful when you have already distributed the question, for example over the radio or at a meeting.

### Response List   
If you selected the "Multiple Choice Question" then the next screen you see will allow you to specify the possible responses to the question. You can enter a maximum of 5 and a must enter a minimum of 2.

Boxes A-C will be immediately available to you to edit. If you need more than 3 responses, when you input something into box C, box D will automatically become active. If you then need more, entering text into box D will activate box E.

Once you have entered all your choices, click next to set up [Automatic Sorting][6].

### Automatic Sorting  
You will be able to specify a keyword, that when included in an incoming message, will allow the system to automatically sort it into the relevant Poll.   

![alt text][14]
  
_Note: Keywords are **unique.** Once a keyword has been set, it cannot be used in a new activity even if the original activity has been archived. To re-use a keyword you have to delete the activity that keyword is associated with.

To set a keyword, select "Sort messages automatically that have the following Keyword:" and then enter your keyword. (character limit?)

Click 'next' to set an [Automatic Reply][5].

### Automatic Reply  
At this screen you can choose to enter a message that will be automatically sent to the senders of messages identified as poll responses. This can only be selected if you have chosen to use a [keyword][2] with your poll. Without a [keyword][2] the system cannot recognise which messages to automatically reply to.  
The automatic reply option will be unavailable until you create a [keyword][2] for your poll.

![alt text][15]

To enable an [Automatic Reply][5], check the "Send an automatic reply to poll responses" box and enter your message in the message.  
This message will be sent out to everyone who sends a message with the [keyword][2] you set up in the previous step.

### Edit Message
This screen will provide you with an opportunity to view the message that will be sent out. If you want, you can also edit the message to add any other text.  

![alt text][16]

The message will be compiled from the options you have selected in previous steps.

If you selected "yes or no" as the question type and created a keyword the default message will look like this:
"[Your Question]? Reply "[Keyword] A" for yes, "[Keyword] B" for no."  

If you did not create a [keyword][2] then the message will look like this:
"[Your Question]? Please reply 'Yes' or 'No'"

If you selected "Multiple Choice Question" as question type and created a keyword, the default message will look like this:
"[Your Question]? Reply "[Keyword] A" for [Multiple Choice A], "[Keyword] B" for [Multiple Choice B], "[Keyword] C" for [Multiple Choice C], "[Keyword] D" for [Multiple Choice D], "[Keyword] E" for [Multiple Choice E]."

If you did not create a [keyword][2] then the message will look like this:
"[Your Question]? Please reply '[Multiple Choice A]' or '[Multiple Choice B]' or '[Multiple Choice C]' or '[Multiple Choice D]' or '[Multiple Choice E]'

Once you are happy with the message, please click 'Next'.

### Select Recipients
On this screen you will be able to either add the numbers of the people you want to send the poll to, or select them from your contacts list. 

![alt text][17]

If you add a number manually it will be added to the list and automatically selected. This number will only remain in the system for as long as it needs to send the message and will not be added to your contacts.  
Selecting groups and contacts is easy, simply select the contacts or groups you want to send the [poll][1].

### Summary Screen
On this screen you will find a summary of all the options you have selected, so you can confirm that what you have created is what you would like to send. 

![alt text][18]

You will also be able to name your [poll][1] so that it is easily recognisable.

Clicking next will create the [poll[1].

### Confirmation
Once successfully created, you will see a confirmation screen like this one:

![alt text][19]

If you do not, and your poll is not visible under 'Activities' in the [Message Functions][6] on the left then please go to the [troubleshooting][7] section.
