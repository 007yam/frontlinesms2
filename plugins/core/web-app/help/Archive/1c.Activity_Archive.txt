### [Activity List View][2]

The Activity List (1) View displays the list of all archived activities. Each row corresponds to a single activity and contains information about the what type of Activity is archived, the date it was archived and how many messages have been archived within the activity.  
  
As with Message Lists, multiple or single activities can be selected in the activity list to be [unarchived][3], [deleted][4] or [exported][5].
