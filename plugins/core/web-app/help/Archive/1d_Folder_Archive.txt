The Folder List View displays the list of all archived Folders. Each row corresponds to a single folder and contains information about  the date it was archived and how many messages have been archived within the folder.  
  
As with Message Lists, multiple or single folders can be selected in the folder list to be [unarchived][2], [deleted][3] or [exported][4].

Clicking on a single folder will take you to that folder's detail view which is described below.
