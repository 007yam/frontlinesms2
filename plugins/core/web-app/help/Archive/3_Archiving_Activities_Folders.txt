# Archiving Activities and Folders

_[Archiving activities][1] removes [activities][2] from the [messages tab][3] and stops new messages being automatically sorted into the [activity][2]. [Archiving folders][1] moves the folder and all the messages within it from the [messages tab][3] and into the [folder archive][4]; this can be particularly useful for reducing the amount of clutter you have on your [messages tab][3] if you have a lot of activities and folders you don't use much anymore. When an [activity][2] has been archived, all the information about that activity is still available. You can still view the graph of poll data, if the activity is a poll, and a summary of all the activity details. The format for the activity remains the same across the [messages tab][3] and [archive tab][5]. You are also able to still [export][6], [rename][7] and [delete][8] activities from the [activity archive][9]_

### [Archiving an Activity][15]

To [archive][1] an [activity][2], follow these steps:

1.  Select the activity you want to [archive][1].
2.  Click on the "Archive [type of activity]" button.
3.  Your activity will have been archived!    

When you archive an activity which uses a keyword, such as [Polls][10], the keyword can not be used again in the creation of a new [poll][10]. If the [activity][2] is deleted, that keyword is then available for use when creating new activities.  

To view your archived activities, navigate to the [archive tab][5] and then click on [activity archive][9] where you will find a list of your archived activities.

### [Archiving a Folder][16]

2.  Click on the "Archive Folder" button.
3.  Your folder will have been archived!
