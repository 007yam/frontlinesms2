# Using the Sent Folder

_The [sent][1] folder contains all the messages you have successfully sent. The messages stored here can be [forwarded][2], [archived][3] and [moved][4]. Forwarding allows you re-send a message you have already sent to more people without having to type out message again. You can also edit the message before you forward it on to more people. This can be useful if you have forgotten to send the message to some people, or need to tailor an existing message to a certain group of people._

### [Forwarding a Sent Message][5]

1.  Select the message you want to forward.
2.  In the [message details][6] on the right of the screen, click on the 'Forward' button.
3.  A new window should appear:  
[screenshot]  
In this window you will be given the opportunity to edit your message's text before you send it.
Once you have finished editing, or if you do not wish to edit the message text, then click 'Next' 

4.  The [recipient selection screen][7] will appear, and you can enter/select to whom the message will be sent. For more help on how to use this screen, click [here][7].
Once you have chosen or added the recipients, click 'Next'.

5.  You will be presented with a confirmation screen summarising the details of your action. Clicking 'Send' will close the window and your messaged will be queued to be sent.
