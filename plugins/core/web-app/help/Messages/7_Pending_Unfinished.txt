# Using the Pending Folder

_The pending folder contains the queue of messages that are waiting to be sent out by FrontlineSMS 2. From this folder you can view those messages which have failed to send and attempt to resend them. Messages that have been successfully sent will be automatically moved from the pending folder to the [sent folder][1]. You can also [move][2], [archive][3], [export][4] and [delete][5] messages in the pending folder._

### [Retrying to Send a Failed Message or Messages][6]

Messages that have failed sending will be indicated by a (insert icon). Clicking on (icon) will display the message history, which will contain information about why the message failed sending.
