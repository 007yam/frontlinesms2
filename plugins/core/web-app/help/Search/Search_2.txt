# Search  #

_FrontlineSMS allows you to quickly search your entire message database so that you can find messages based on content. You can also modify your search to look in specific places like [activites][1], [folders][2], [archives][3], [date ranges][4] and a range of other parameters.  You can then perform standard actions on the messages which match your search criteria directly from within the search window, making it easy to work with the results. You can also [export][5] your search results in either .csv or .pdf format if you need to use them in another program._

### Performing a Search

Navigate to the [Search][5] tab in the top header and you will see a screen as follows:

![alt text][12]

On the left hand side (a) you will find the area where you input your search criteria and can set the search parameters. In the messages list (b) you will see the area which will display your search results.

### A Basic Search

Performing a simple search that will look through the content of all the messages in your system, wherever they are stored, is very easy and can be done in 2 steps:

1. Enter what you want to search for in the Keyword or Phrase box. (1)
2. Press 'Search' at the bottom of the left menu .

Any messages across the whole system containing the exact keyword or phrase will be displayed in the messages list (b).

### Advanced Search

Modifying the search parameters so that you can tell the search where and where not to look is  also quite simple . Any combination of the parameters can be used together to create very specific searches.   
  
There are three ways you can modify the search parameters:

(2): Using the parameters under '[Limit Search To][6]'.
(3): Defining a date range under '[Between Dates][7]'
(4): Using additional search criteria like contact names, or extra fields, found under '[More Search Options][8]'.

To begin, enter what you want to search for in the 'Keyword or Phrase' box. If you simply want search results to show all messages within parameters which you set then leave this field blank.

They are explained in detail below:

__[Limit Search To:][6]__
Click on the arrow on the right to see a drop down of options which you can select. 
 
(5) Select Group: Allows you to confine the search to messages sent or received by contacts in the selected group. 

(6) Select Activity/Folder: Allows you to confine the search to messages contained within the selected activity or folder.

(7) All Sent and Received: By default the search will display both sent and received messages. This allows you to confine the search to only sent messages or only received messages. 
  
Parameters can be used together. For example, selecting a group and selecting sent messages only, will only search the messages sent to contacts of that group.

(8) Include Archive: If this box is checked then [archived messages][9] will be included in the search. If it isn't checked then archived messages will not be included.

__[Between Dates][7]__
This section allows you to specify either a range of dates, or a start/end date for the search.
  
##### Start Date   
A start date, is a date from which the search will be conducted. Any messages sent or received (depending on the parameter selected) before this date will be ignored. For example, if you set the start date to 20th March, 2007 then all the messages sent/received _after_ this date will be included in the search. Messages sent _before_ this date will be ignored.  
  
To set a start date, simply set a date in the "From" (9) fields __or__ click on the {calendar} icon to open a widget where you can select a date which will fill out the drop boxes automatically. Leaving the “To” (10) fields blank will perform the search until the current date.

##### End Date
An end date, is a date beyond which the search will not be conducted. Any messages sent or received (depending on the parameter selected) after this date will be ignored. For example, if you set the end date to the 16th June, 2008 then all the messages sent/received _before_ this date will be included in the search. Messages sent _after_ this date will be ignored .

To set an end date, simply set a date in the "To" (10) fields __or__ click on the {calendar} icon to open a widget where you can select a date which will fill out the drop boxes automatically. If you want results to go back to when you first started messaging using FrontlineSMS, make sure you leave the "From" fields blank.

##### Date Range
Simply enter two dates in the "From" and "To" fields, either by selecting the day, month and year from the drop down boxes, or by using the calendar widget (icon) to click on a date which will automatically fill in the drop boxes for you. The search will then only search messages that were sent/received within the two dates you have specified. 

__[More Search Options][8]__
Clicking the (down arrow) will present you with a list of extra parameters which can be used to narrow your search. For example, if you wish to search for all the texts corresponding to a particular contact, then choosing 'Contact Name' will create a field for you to enter the name of the contact you want to search for. Other parameters shown here include any custom fields (link to meaning) you have created for your contacts.    
  
For example, if you created a field called 'Town' for some contacts, then you can select this as a search parameter here and type in the detail which you would like the search to match. The search will bring up all messages from contacts who have a custom field matching the town you have entered.   
  
Multiple parameters can be used simultaneously. You could add 'Contact Name' and 'Town' and any number of other custom fields.  
  
To remove a parameter, simply click the (x icon) next to the field.

### Example Search
Here is an example of how you might set up an advanced search which uses all of the parameters.   
  
In this example search, we  will be searching for received messages with the keyword "Maize" from a contact group called “Farmers” who participated in an [activity][1] called  “Crops”. We will also specifically want to know which farmers from the town Kisumu use Maize. Furthermore, we want only the messages that were received in April, 2011. To perform this search we would do the following:

1.  In the 'Keyword and Phrase' box type in 'Maize'. 
2.  In the '[Limit Search To][6]' we would set the drop boxes to the following settings:  
  
'Select Group' to 'Farmers'  
'Select Activity/Folder' to 'Crops’
'All Sent and Received' to 'Only Received Messages'  
  
3.  In the 'From' group of drop down boxes we will click on the calendar widget (icon), use the left and right arrows to scroll to the month of April. Once we are viewing the calendar for April, we would select the first day of the month.  
4. In the 'To' group of drop down boxes we will click on the calendar widget (icon), use the left and right arrows to scroll to the month of April. Once we are viewing the calendar for April, we would select the last day of the month.  
5.  Clicking the 'More Search Options' will open a list of custom fields. Clicking on 'Town' would activate that field and create a text box for data entry.  
6.  In the newly created 'Town' parameter, we would enter 'Kisumu'.  
7.  With all the parameters set all that is left is to click "Search"  to view the results!
