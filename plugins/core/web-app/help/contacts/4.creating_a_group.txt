# Creating a Group

With groups you can organise your contacts to make the sending and receiving of messages easier to manage. You are able to edit the group by [adding and removing contacts][1] once it has been created. Groups can be helpful when you have a large number of a certain type of contact. For example, you may have number of contacts that are farmers. You can add all these contacts to a group, which will make viewing and sending messages from this group much simpler, as groups are easily selectable when [choosing recipients][2].
