### Restoring from a backup

1.  Navigate to the Settings menu.(1)
2.  In the section entitled "Import" (2), select the type of data you will be importing. Please select the correct type otherwise the import will fail.
3.  Click on "Choose File" and navigate to the .CSV file that you wish to import and select it.
4.  FrontlineSMS will begin importing your messages or contacts. If you have a large number of contacts or messages, this process could take a few minutes so please be patient.

If the import was unsuccessful, or some contacts or messages failed to import, a notification will appear with a summary of the process. You will also be able to download a .CSV file containing the failed messages or contacts so that you can correct them and re-attempt import easily.
