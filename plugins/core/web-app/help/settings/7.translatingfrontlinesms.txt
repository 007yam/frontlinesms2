# Translating FrontlineSMS Version 2

_FrontlineSMS Version 2 offers the opportunity to translate the interface into a language that isn't currently supported. Your translation will then be made available in all future revisions of the software for everyone to utilise._

### Preparation

At present, you can translate the FrontlineSMS Version 2 interface into another language using the method below.

This method involves manually editing the core language file of FrontlineSMS Version 2 to replace the English text used in the program with equivalent text from the language you are translating to. As such, it may be a lengthy and time consuming process which demands some familiarity with computers.

There is **no risk** to damaging your installation of FrontlineSMS Version 2 as long as these instructions are followed carefully. Once you have completed the conversion, you will have to send us the file, via e-mail to hussain@frontlinesms, so that we can generate the text in a format the software can read. Once we receive the file, we will check it and add it to the software as a selectable language. Your translation will typically be available via an update to the software.

**These instructions are for Windows computers.** However, the general method does not differ between platforms and is applicable to Mac systems as well.

Before you begin, it is highly recommended that you download and install [Notepad++][2]. It is a small and free software which will make editing the core language file a much more pleasant and streamlined process. Once at the Notepad++ website, click on “Download” on the left hand side and select the first entry for the latest version of Notepad++. Once you have finished translating FrontlineSMS Version 2 you can uninstall Notepad++ if you wish to.

You can use other similar editors, and even the built in Notepad software of Windows. Unfortunately, this may result in a more difficult editing experience because these editors may read the format of the language file incorrectly. Consequently, your editing experience may differ from the one outlined below.

### How to translate FrontlineSMS Version 2

1.Navigate to the directory you specific to installed FrontlineSMS Version 2.  

The default location on a 32-bit Windows computer is: C:\program files\frontlinesms2  

The default location on a 64-bit Windows computer is: C:\program files (x86)\frontlinesms2

2.Once in this folder, navigate to: **web-app\WEB-INF\grails-app\i18n**  

3.In this folder you should see 2 files: **messages.properties** and **messages_sw.properties**  

Right-click on messages.properties and select “Copy” from the menu that appears. Go to your desktop, or any other safe location on your computer and Paste a copy of the file there. You have just created a backup copy of the file, in the off chance that something goes wrong. Remember where you saved this backup.

4.We **only** want to use the **messages.properties** file. So, open Notepad++ (or whichever program you are using for editing) and open this file in the editor using File>>Open **OR** drag and drop the **messages.properties** file into the Notepad++ window.  

5.Once open, you should see something similar to the below:  

    <# FrontlineSMS English translation by the FrontlineSMS team, Nairobi>  
    language.name=English  

    <# Common action imperatives - to be used for button labels and similar>   
    action.ok=OK  
    action.close=Close  
    action.cancel=Cancel  
    action.done=Done  
    action.next=Next  
    action.prev=Previous  
    action.back=Back  
    action.create=Create  
    action.edit=Edit  
    action.rename=Rename  
    action.delete=Delete  
    action.send=Send  
    action.export=Export  

    <#Connections:>  
    connection.creation.failed = Connection could not be created {0}  
    connection.route.destroyed = Destroyed route from {0} to {1}  
    connection.route.connecting = Connecting...  
    connection.route.disconnecting = Disconnecting...  
    connection.route.successNotification = Successfully created route on {0}  
    connection.route.failNotification = Failed to create route on {0}  
    connection.route.destroyNotification = Disconnected route on {0}  
    connection.test.sent = Test message successfully sent to {0} using {1}   
 
If you aren’t using Notepad++ you may see something different.  

While editing this file there are some guidelines that should be followed to ensure that your translation will work once converted:

**Do Not** edit the _keys_. These are all the entries on the left of the = sign. For example, connection.creation.failed is a key.
  
**Do Not** edit the _arguments_. These are indicated by { }. The location of the argument in the sentence or phrase can be adjusted but the content of the brackets should not be altered.  

**Do edit** the English phrases on the right of the = sign.  

6.The first and most important step is to update the value of the **language.name** key. This is found at the top of the file and lets us and other users know what language you have translated into.  

Replace “English” with the name of the language you are translating to and move on to the next step.

7.Once you have entered the name of the translation, the rest of the process involved substituting the English with their translated equivalents for each key.  

>**Some tips:** When substituting English phrases with their translated equivalents, it is important to remember that the grammar of phrases and/or words may not be the same between the language. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the grammar is correct for the language you are translating into.

>For example:

>message.deleted.many={0} messages deleted

>This key indicates the text used when multiple messages are deleted. The {0} will indicate the number of messages that were deleted. >Hence, in English this sentence is grammatically correct.

>Let’s translate this into Swahili:

>message.deleted.many={0} risala imefutwa

>This is **not correct**. We need to make sure that the phrase makes grammatical sense in Swahili:

>message.deleted.many=risala {0} imefutwa

>This is **correct**. Note that we moved the argument to ensure the phrase makes grammatical sense. This is fine to do as long as you do >not edit the contents of the brackets.

8.When you have finished translation the file needs to be saved. **Do not** overwrite the **messages.properties** file that exists currently. Instead, choose File>Save As..  

Pick a location that you can remember and find again.

Enter the file name in the following format: message_[language_name].properties. So, for Swahili the file name would be: message_swahili.properties

9.Send an e-mail to hussain@frontlinesms.com with the file attached and include the name of the language in the translation.  

We will then get to work on integrating your translation into the software. We greatly appreciate all the work you have put in and are thankful for your time and effort. Your work will help make the software usable by a wider range of people and in a greater range of contexts.
