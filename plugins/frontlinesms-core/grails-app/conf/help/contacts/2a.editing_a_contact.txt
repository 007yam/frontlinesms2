# Editing a Contact

On this page you will find out how to modify an existing contact.

### Editing a contact

To modify the information saved under a contact, you have to navigate to the selected contact in the [contacts tab][2] and make the changes. Your changes will then be saved automatically.

1. Navigate to the [contacts tab][2].
2. Select the contact you wish to edit by either finding it in the [contact list][3] OR using the [search][4] feature in the [contact footer][5].
3. In the [contact details][6] area, make the necessary edits to the contact.
4. Once you have made the changes, the contact details will be saved automatically. You will also see the phone number auto-format and show the relevant country flag. If the country flag is incorrect, it's a good visual cue for you to check to make sure the phone number is correctly entered in an international format. **Your changes will be saved automatically.**
