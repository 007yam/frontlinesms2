# Translating FrontlineSMS Version 2

_FrontlineSMS Version 2 offers the opportunity to translate the interface into a language that isn't currently supported. Your translation will then be made available in all future revisions of the software for everyone to use._

All Frontline products work with a user-friendly, internet-based application for internationalizing, or translating, the platform. The application allows you to translate the core language file of FrontlineSMS line-by-line, replacing the English text with equivalent text from the language or dialect of your choice.

As such, the process demands an internet connection and some familiarity with computers. 

We welcome volunteers to translate our applications into any language or dialect, and we will make the translations available to others who speak the same language or dialect as you. In other words, all of your work in providing a translation will benefit everyone in the Frontline community.

If you are interested in translating FrontlineSMS, please get in touch with us directly at support@frontlinesms.com
