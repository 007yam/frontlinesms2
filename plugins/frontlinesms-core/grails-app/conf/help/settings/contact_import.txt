You can import contacts into FrontlineCloud as a .csv file (comma separated value) or vCard (.vcf file). These are common database and phone contact formats. You can import contacts using the following steps.
Step 1: Make Sure Your Database Is Correctly Formatted
If you can export contacts as a .csv from a program you are currently using, then all you need to do is adjust the column headings. The column headings should follow the example in the screenshot below. Note that "group" is optional; it will be interpreted by FrontlineCloud as a group tag for the contact.
If you need help getting the format correct, you could enter a few contacts directly into FrontlineCloud, then export those as a .csv file. Open this in a spreadsheet application such as OpenOffice or Microsoft Excel, and add your contacts under the appropriate columns. You can probably copy and paste these from your own database. Once finished, save your new contacts file as a .csv, and import into FrontlineCloud.
Note: the column headings must be exact (e.g. 'E-mail Address', not 'email address')

Note: If you are importing using vCards, you only need to ensure that your contact's mobile number is correctly listed as a mobile number; FrontlineCloud will ignore other numbers.



Step 2: Import Contacts

Go to "Account Management," then select "Import and Export" from the drop-down menu. From there, select the file format you wish to use for your contacts (.csv or vCard). Click 'Browse' and find the file on your computer. You can see how to do both of these things in the screenshot below:

Select your file, and then click 'open.'

Step 3: Review contact import. Confirm that your contact headings are correct, and that your contact information looks correct.

FrontlineCloud gives you the option to review your contact imports and make edits before finalizing the import. The most critical step is to make sure the contact headings are correctly formatted. Correctly formatted headings will appear as green, where as incorrect headings will appear as a pale yellow. You can see a sample below.

Note that you can also update names and numbers directly in the list if you would like.


Step 4: Click "Import Contacts" to finalize the import.

A button for importing contacts appears at the top and bottom of the list. Clicking the button will finalize the import.
