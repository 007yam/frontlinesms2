# Creating a Poll 

A poll is a type of activity which allows you to see a graphical representation of the responses to a question. When creating a poll you will be able to enter the question and select who to send the question to. You will also be able to set up a **keyword**. A **keyword** allows FrontlineSMS to recognize which incoming messages are for polls and which aren't. It will also help the system determine which poll the message belongs to. This gives you the option to let FrontlineSMS automatically sort incoming messages into polls - you will be notified when this has happened. There are two types of responses you can set: Yes/No or a Multiple Choice style answer. You can also set up an **automatic reply** that is sent to every message received for that poll. This makes polls useful for contexts where you want to see the response to a particular issue or question.

## How to Create a Poll

1.  From the messages tab click on 'Create New Activity'.
2.  A new window will appear and you will be presented with a number of options. Choose "Poll" and click next
![Activity Select][8]

### Enter Question  

After clicking next, you will be prompted to select a question type and enter a question:

![Enter Question][9]

#### Question Type: 
Yes or No: Select this if your question has a Yes or No answer. For example, the question "Do you like the colour Red?", could have a Yes or No Answer.

Multiple Choice Question: Select this if your question has a number of different answers. For example, with the question "Do you like the colour Red?", you could get more detailed responses by having a range of answers such as, "Yes", "Quite a lot", "Not a lot" or "No". If you select this option you will have the opportunity to input the possible responses in the following screens.

#### Enter Question:
Here you will find an area for you to enter your question. You can re-size the text entry box by clicking and dragging the bottom right-hand corner of it.  
  
If you simply want to collect responses and not send out a question then check "Do not send a message for this poll (Collect responses only)". This might be useful when you have already distributed the question, for example over the radio or at a meeting.

### Response List  
If you selected the "Multiple Choice Question" then the next screen you see will allow you to specify the possible responses to the question. You can enter a maximum of 5 and a must enter a minimum of 2.

![Response List][10]

Boxes A-C will be immediately available to you to edit. If you need more than 3 responses, when you input something into box C, box D will automatically become active. If you then need more, entering text into box D will activate box E.

Once you have entered all your choices, click next to set up Automatic Sorting.

### Automatic Sorting  
First, you can choose whether or not FrontlineSMS will process incoming SMS automatically using a keyword for this activity. If you choose not to, then only messages you manually move into this activity will be processed. To sort using a keyword, select 'sort responses automatically'.

![Automatic Sorting][17]
  
_**Note:** Top Level Keywords are **unique.** Once a top level keyword has been used in an activity it cannot be used in another activity, unless that activity is archived or deleted. In polls, top-level responses are optional. If you decide to allow respondents to text in only one word to vote, i.e. not to provide a top-level keyword, then the response keywords are treated as top-level and must be unique across all the activity top level keywords.

To set the keywords, select "Sort responses automatically.' and then set the keywords in the text boxes below.

For any keyword, including each response, you can enter any number of keywords separated by commas. With this setting, any incoming message that starts with one of those keywords will trigger the activity. This means that you can cater for spelling errors, different languages, and other reasons for differing keywords.

Default keywords will be pre-entered, but can be edited here. 

![Keywords][17]

An example would be:

"Yes, A, yeah, yeh"

The first response keyword will be the one used in generating a sample message in the "Edit Message" step. To change how each choice appears in the message that will be sent out, change the first entry in the text area.

If the text area looks like this for example:

"Yeah, A, yes, yeh"

Then "Yeah" will be used as part of the outgoing message text for the Poll.

Once you have completed this section click "Next" to set up an "Automatic Reply".

**_Automatic Reply_**
At this screen you can choose to enter a message that will be automatically sent to the senders of messages identified as poll responses. This can only be selected if you have chosen to use a keyword with your poll. Without a keyword the system cannot recognise which messages to automatically reply to.  

The automatic reply option will be unavailable until you create a keyword for your poll.

![Automatic Reply][12]

To enable an automatic reply, check the "Send an automatic reply to poll responses" box and enter your message in the text box.

This message will be sent out to everyone who sends a message with the keyword you set up in the previous step.

**_Note:** This is different from the [auto-reply activity][3]._

**_Edit Message_**  
This screen will provide you with an opportunity to view the message that will be sent out. If you want, you can also edit the message to add any other text.  

![Edit Message][13]

The message will be compiled from the options you have selected in previous steps. Once you are happy with the message, please click 'Next'.

**_Select Recipients_**
On this screen you will be able to either add the numbers of the people you want to send the poll to, or select them from your contacts list. 

![Select Recipients][14]

If you add a number manually it will be added to the list and automatically selected. This number will only remain in the system for as long as it needs to send the message and will not be added to your contacts.  

**_Summary Screen_**
On this screen you will find a summary of all the options you have selected, the message you've created (if applicable) and the recipients you've chosen. 

![Summary][15]

You will also be able to name your poll so that it is easily recognisable.

_**Note:** Activity names must be unique. You cannot have two activities with the same name. When an activity is deleted **and** removed from the trash, that name can then be used in any new activities._

Clicking next will create the poll.

**_Confirmation_**
Once successfully created, you will see a confirmation screen like this one:

![Confirmation][16]

Your poll will be displayed under the "Activities" sub heading in the [messages tab][7].
