# Creating a Subsctiption #

A subscription is a type of activity that allows users to join a specified group or leave that group based on the content of the message that they text in. The subsccription will matcj the test message against the keywords in that activity and choose whether to join the contact to the group, leave the contact from the group or toggle the group membership of the contact.

### How to Create an Subsctiption
From the [messages tab][2] click on 'Create New Activity'.
A new window will appear and you will be presented with a number of options. Choose "Subscription" and click next

![Select Activity][7]

#### Select a Group
You can select the group that contacts will join or leave.

![Select A Group][8]

When you have selected the desired group click next.

#### Automatic Sorting
![Automatic Sorting][9]

On this tab you will be able to determine if messages will be sorted into the subscription or not. To disable automatic sorting of message into the subscription, please check the 'Disable automatic sorting' checkbox in the Automatic Sorting section.

If you want contact to automatically join and leave the group then you need to have sorting enabled. You may decide to enter a top level keywords(seperated by commas) or to leave it blank. The top level keyword is optional.

A subscription needs keywords that will match to the join action (Contact will join the group) and keywords that will match the leave action (Contact will leave the group). The keywords for subscription actions are not optional and need to filled in. At least one keyword per acton needs to be present. The keywords in a subsciption, inclucing top level and subsctipition action keywords need to be unique within that subsctiption.
The top level keywords if provided needs to be unique across all activities and their respective top level keywords. If the top level keyword is not provided then the subscription action keywords (join and leave keywords) become top level and need to be unique across all activites and their top level keywords.

A subscription allows a default action to be triggered if a message matched a top level keyword and did not match at least one subscription action keyword.

Take for example a subscription where sorting is enabled and keywords look as follows.

	Top level keywords : 'team, tim, tom'
	Join Keywords : 'join, in, inthere'
	Leave Ketwords : 'leave, out, ouththere'
	Default Action : Add Contact to the Group
