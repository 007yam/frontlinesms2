# New features in FrontlineSMS v 2.2.0
## New activities
### Subscriptions
This activity allows users to add and remove themselves from groups by texting in certain keywords. For example, a user may text on 'join' to join a group or 'leave' to leave a group. This means that, for example, they can choose to join groups that control recipients of certain alerts or information, such as events listings; or could sign up as volunteers. 

### Web Connections
This activity allows you to set up a connection to a web-based server or service, such as Ushahidi or Twitter. A FrontlineSMS deployment instance can upload messages to a specified url, and an incoming action, like a piece of data pushed from a database, can trigger an outbound SMS. We have included a custom integration with Ushahidi and Crowdmap, so that users can easily link their FrontlineSMS instance to the popular mapping platform.

##Improvements
We have made a major improvement to the way keywords function, so that you can make it simpler for your users to text you.

### Multiple keywords for activities
Autor-eplies, Polls, Web Connections and Subscriptions now allow you to list more that one keyword to trigger a specific activity. This means Â you can support more than one language or spelling of a word.

### Single keywords in Poll
Similarly, Polls now optionally allows you to set only one keyword for poll responses - so answers could just be YES, NO, or whatever multiple choice answer you set. You can still set two-level keywords, for example in the poll about food, sample answers might be FOOD PIE or FOOD SODA. The new single keyword setting allows you simply to text in PIE or SODA
