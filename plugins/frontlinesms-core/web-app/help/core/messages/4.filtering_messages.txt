# Filtering Message Lists

When viewing a message list anywhere in the program, you can search within that list, across the From, Message and Date columns. If you are looking for messages from a particular contact, you can enter their name or number into the box at the foot of the list, and the list will be filtered to show the results. Further, you can filter your message list to show all messages or only those that have been [starred][1].

1.  At the bottom of the message list (1) you will see the above option to show All or [Starred][1].
2.  Clicking on [starred][1] will cause only starred messages to appear in the message list.
3.  Clicking on All will cause all messages to be displayed.

_**Note**: Navigating away from this list will cause the message list to revert to its default state of showing All messages._
