# Getting Around Shows

You can access shows from the messages tab. When you click on a show for the first time, you will notice that it has a slightly different layout in comparison to the [message inbox][1]. This is because a show performs a specialised function to track the flow of messages and activities while a show is on air. The unique interface for shows has been designed so that information can be accessed and managed easier.

### Show Header

This large header (1) contains the "Start Show" and "Stop Show" buttons.

__Start Show:__ Clicking on "Start Show" will cause the "On Air" icon to flash. While this is flashing all incoming messages will be stored in the Shows folder.

__Stop Show:__ Click on "Stop Show" will cause the "on Air" icon to stop flashing. FrontlineSMS will return to normal and all incoming messages will go to the inbox.

The [Quick Message][2] button and buttons to [Archive][3] show, [Export][4] show, [Rename][5] show and [Delete][6] show can be accessed from this header as well. 

Clicking on '[Show WordCloud][7]' (2) allows you to see a visual representation of the message content within the show. The words from all texts contained within the show will be displayed in a cloud to allow you to analyse the themes of incoming messages. For more information click [here][7]:

### Message List

The message list (3) functions like any other message list in FrontlineSMS. You are able to star, sort and multiple select messages.

When viewing a Show, the message list will display some additional information:

Divider bars (4) will appear once a show has been run over more than one day, to help separate messages received on the different days that the show was run.

### Message Details

The message detail area (5) contains the full text of the selected message and sender details, or information about how many messages have been selected. 

You can [reply][9], [move][9], [forward][9] and [delete][9] messages from here.
