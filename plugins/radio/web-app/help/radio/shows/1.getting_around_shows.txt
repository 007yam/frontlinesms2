# Getting Around Shows

Shows are a useful way to manage messages based on the time they are received. Shows act like a folder to manage messages which enter FrontlineSMS during the time you indicate that a show is on air. You can access the shows functionality from the messages tab.  The unique interface for shows has been designed so that information can be accessed and managed more easily. Shows are particularly useful when multiple users are using the same instance of FrontlineSMS and want to capture SMS in a certain time frame such as a radio presenter.
