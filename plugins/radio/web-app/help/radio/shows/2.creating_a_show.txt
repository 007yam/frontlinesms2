# Creating a Show

Shows are a unique feature of FrontlineSMS:Radio. When you are on air, you can ensure that any messages received during that time are sent to that particular show. This helps you to manage all the messages according to the time they are received by FrontlineSMS and allows you to control when messages start and stop being routed to your own inbox. Shows streamline the SMS process during a Radio show allowing the presenter or operator to worry less about the technicalities and more about using the content in incoming messages. They are also useful when FrontlineSMS is used by multiple people so they are able to manage their own space in the system. This help page will explain the steps required for creating a new Show.
