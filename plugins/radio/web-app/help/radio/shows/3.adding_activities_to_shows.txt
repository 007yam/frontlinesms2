# Adding Activities to Shows

You have the option to associate activities with shows to allow you to manage your activities more efficiently. Once you have added an activity to a show it will be displayed indented, underneath the corresponding show. This will help anyone running a show to customise their view of activities which they control. This page will explain how to add an activity to a show. You can add an activity to a show, either in the activity walkthrough when you are setting up the activity or by entering the activity from the messages tab once it has been created. Both methods will be explained below as well as the procedure to undo the association between an activity and a show. 


### Adding an Activity to a Show in the Activity set up 

1.  Whenever you set up an activity like a poll or autoreply you will be given the option to 'Add to Radio show' in the first page of the walkthrough. Select the show from the dropdown menu.
__*Note:* If you have not created any shows then there will be no options available for you to select. Please create a show first.__
2. If you have already set up the activity, navigate to the activity you wish to add to your show.
3.  When viewing this activity, click on "More Actions..." and then click on "Edit [Activity Type]" e.g. "Edit Autoreply" (2).In the first screen it says"Add to Radio Show." Select the show from the dropdown menu. You can also make other changes to the activity in the walkthrough.

### Removing activities from shows

2.  When viewing this activity, click on "More Actions..." and then click on "Edit [Activity Type]" e.g. "Edit Autoreply"

4.  Click through to the confirmation screen and click 'Create' to save changes.
5.  The activity will be removed from the show, and moved underneath the Activities header on the messages tab.

You can achieve the same result When viewing the activity by clicking on "More Actions..." and then on "Add to Radio Show" and selecting "None."
