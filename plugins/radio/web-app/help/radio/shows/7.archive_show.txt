# Archiving Shows

Archiving a Show removes it, and any activities associated with it, from the messages tab and stops new messages being automatically sorted into the show and it's activities. This can be particularly useful for reducing the amount of clutter you have on your screen if you have a lot of shows you don't use much anymore. When a show has been archived, all the information about that show is still available. You can still view the WordCloud. The format for the Show remains the same across the messages tab and archive tab. You are also able to still [export][1], [rename][2] and [delete][3] Shows from the [show archive][4]

### Archiving a Show

To archive a Show, follow these steps:

1.  Select the Show you want to archive.
2.  Click on the "Archive" button (1).
3.  Your Show will have been archived!    

If your archived Show has Activities associated with it, they will also be archived. If these Activities use a keyword, such as a [Poll activity][6], the keyword can not be used again in the creation of a new [poll][6]. If the [activity is deleted][7], that keyword is then available for use when creating new activities.  

To view your archived shows, navigate to the [archive tab][8] and then click on [show archive][4]. You will find a list of your archived activities.
