# Word Clouds 

The Word Cloud feature allows you to see a visual representation of the most prominent words included in incoming text messages.  The tool is particularly useful for analyzing free-form text (rather than structured responses). The Word Cloud allows you to view the most common themes and issues at a glance and allows you to analyze themes of incoming messages. The Word Cloud offers more prominence to words that appear more frequently. Words which appear in a larger font in the cloud have been mentioned more times than those which appear in small font. They include the top 100 most frequently used words.


### Show Word Cloud View

Word clouds can be viewed to analyze content of any show, activity or inbox. The example here is from a Show, but the same method can be used to display Word Clouds in the Inbox, Sent, Activity and Folder inboxes.

1. Navigate to the show you wish to see a Word Cloud for.
2. Click on 'Show WordCloud' to see a visual representation of the message content within that show. Words from all texts contained within the show from all dates will be displayed in a cloud.

3. If you hover over a Word you are interested in and then click on it, you will be directed to a [search][2] result on the basis of this keyword. This allows you to find out more about the context of messages containing this word. 
4. To return to the message view click on "Message List"

_**Note:** that Word Clouds are not automatically refreshed to include texts entering FrontlineSMS after you have entered the Word Cloud view. Refresh your browsr or leave and then re-enter the show or activity to include the most recent messages._

### Ignore words in Word Cloud View

Word clouds can be unhelpful if they make commonly used or less meaningful words like 'the' or 'and' most prominent. Rather, they are useful when they display key topics people are texting about. This is why you are able to customize words which appear in the visual by ignoring words which do not contribute to your analysis.

The Word Cloud will remember words you have chosen to ignore while you're on that page and if you switch between the message list and Word Cloud view.

To include ignored words again, click "Reset Word Cloud" This will bring back all ignored words into the view. Leaving and then re-entering the show or refreshing the page will also reset the Word Cloud and bring back ignored words

_**Note:** you will need to customize the view each time you enter as we do not currently have the ability to select lists of ignored words across the system._
